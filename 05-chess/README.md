## 📋 About

A complete two-player chess game running in the terminal. Built from scratch using core OOP principles — inheritance, polymorphism, abstraction and encapsulation — with a custom stack implementation for move history and undo functionality.

> 📌 This was the **Final Project** for the subject **Object-Oriented Programming** — Semester 03.

## ♟️ Pieces Implemented

| Piece | Symbol | Movement |
|-------|--------|----------|
| King | `wK` / `bK` | One square any direction |
| Queen | `wQ` / `bQ` | Any direction, unlimited range |
| Rook | `wR` / `bR` | Horizontal & vertical, unlimited range |
| Bishop | `wB` / `bB` | Diagonal, unlimited range |
| Knight | `wN` / `bN` | L-shaped jumps |
| Pawn | `wP` / `bP` | Forward move, diagonal capture |

**🎮 Gameplay**
- Full two-player turn-based chess in the console
- Coordinate-based input (e.g., `e2` → `e4`)
- Move cancellation with `cancel` command
- Resign anytime with `quit`

**♟️ Chess Rules Fully Implemented**
- Legal move validation for all 6 piece types
- Check & Checkmate detection
- Stalemate detection
- En Passant
- Castling (Kingside & Queenside)
- Pawn Promotion
- 50-Move Rule draw
- Threefold Repetition draw
- Insufficient Material draw

## 🏗️ Architecture

The project is built across **13 classes** following clean OOP design:
```
Piece (abstract base)
├── Pawn
├── Rook
├── Knight
├── Bishop
├── Queen
└── King

Square         — represents one cell on the board
Board          — manages the 8×8 grid and all game logic
Move           — stores move metadata (from, to, flags)
MyStack<T>     — custom generic stack for move history
GameFlow       — handles the game loop and user input
```

---

## 🕹️ How to Play
```
e2          → select the piece at e2
e4          → move it to e4
cancel      → deselect the current piece
draw        → offer a draw to opponent
quit        → resign and exit
```

After each move you'll be asked if you want to undo it. Enter `y` to undo or `n` to continue.

## 🚀 How to Run

### Option 1 — Any C++ Compiler
```bash
g++ *.cpp -o chess && ./chess

```

### Option 2 — Visual Studio

1. Create a new **Empty C++ Project**
2. Add all `.cpp` and `.h` files to the project
3. Set platform to **x64**
4. Press **`Ctrl+F5`** to build and run

> No external libraries required — standard C++ only.
